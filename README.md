user2016format
==============

This is a series of R Markdown document-format functions used to show how you can put together your own custom format.

I would be shocked if this was ever submitted to CRAN. However, you may install from github:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ijlyttle/user2016format")
```
