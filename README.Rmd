# user2016docdemo

This is a series of R Markdown document-format functions used to show how you can put together your own custom format.

All of the custom formatting functions rely on `rmarkdown::html_document()`. The help documentation for the functions here are extracted from the `html_document()` documentation.

I would be shocked if this was ever submitted to CRAN. However, you may install from github:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ijlyttle/user2016docdemo")
```
